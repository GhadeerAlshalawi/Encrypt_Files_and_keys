# Encrypt_Files_and_keys
information security course project
In this project, we programmed a system that encrypted the content of the files using the AES algorithm and the encryption key used to encrypt the content using the public key of the file receiver provided or used by the RSA algorithm in addition to decrypting it using a simple user interface that is easy to understand and use.
